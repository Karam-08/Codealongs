    <h1>Back To The Future</h1>
    <h2>Plot:</h2>
        <h3>Part 1:</h3>
            <p>A man named Dr. Emmet Brown creates a time machine with a Delorean. It requires massive amounts of Energy, so he steals Uranium from a group of Libyan Terrorists. They find him and supposedly kill him. Marty McFly, who was with Dr. Brown, accidentally time travels back to 1955. He accidentally meets his parents and his mom falls in love with him. He finds Dr. Brown from the past and finds out that the clock tower gets struck by lighting in one week. With his Delorean Time Machine, he can harness the lightning's power to time travel himself back to 1985. He gets his parents back together and goes Back to 1985.</p>
        <h3>Part 2:</h3>
            <p>Near the end of Part 1, Dr. Brown goes to the year 2015. He comes back to 1985 and tells Marty to come with him. They go to 2015 to save Marty McFly Jr. from being set up for a crime by Griff Tannen. Marty poses as his son and manages to prevent this. However, Bill Tannen steals the time machine for himself and gets rich by giving his past self from 1955 a Sports Almanac. In 1985, he becomes rich and 1985 is now a Dystopian World. Marty McFly and Dr. Brown have to go back to 1955 to prevent Bill Tannen from obtaining that Almanac. They eventually succeed, but Dr. Brown's Time Machine malfunctions after being struck by lightning and has teleported somewhere else.</p>
        <h3>Part 3:</h3>
            <p>We find out that Dr. Brown time traveled to the year 1885. He sent a letter saying that he hid a time machine inside a cave. With the help of 1955 Dr. Brown, they find the Delorean Time Machine with the hope that Marty will travel back to 1985. He finds out that Dr. Brown dies in 1885 over a deal of $70. He decides to go back to 1885 to save Dr. Brown. Marty arrives in Hill Valley and has an encounter with Buford Tannen and his gang. Dr. Brown saves him and when he learns of his fate, he agrees to go back to 1985. Since the Delorean had no gas, they had to use a Train to get to 88 Miles per Hour. While they were figuring out their plan to get back to the future, Doc saves a woman named Clara from death, and they fall in love at first sight. Buford challenges Marty to a showdown, calling him a chicken, which makes Marty accept. Buford captures Dr. Brown, making Marty accept the match. Marty beats Buford and shoves him into a wagon full of manure. Dr. Brown stays in 1885 because Clara is very important to him. Marty comes back to 1985 and destroys the Delorean Time Machine, just as Dr. Brown wished to do. The story ends with Dr. Brown coming to 1985 with a modified Train Time Machine. He gives some wisdom and then flies off into an unknown time period.</p>
        <h3>My thoughts on Back to The Future:</h3>
            <p>I think that it is one of the best trilogies of all time. It's fun, has funny moments, and cool family friendly Sci-Fi. The Time traveling concept is a very cool idea. The series also shows the consqeuences if time travel goes into the wrong hands.</p>
